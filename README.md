# About

An R package to help organize helper functions that I write, as well as packages that contain a number of awesome tools to help with the top half of a data project.

I just want to load 1 package to have the basic tools I need.  It's really to make my flow easier and control my own destiny; I don't want to remember which awesome package had that cool feature, I just want to remember the function name.
